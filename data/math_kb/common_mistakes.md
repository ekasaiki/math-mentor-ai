## Algebra

### Ignoring Domain Restrictions
Dividing by zero or taking square roots of negative numbers leads to invalid solutions.

### Losing Solutions
Squaring both sides of an equation can introduce extraneous solutions.
Always verify the final answer.

## Calculus

### Incorrect Application of Power Rule
For f(x) = x^n, forgetting to multiply by n is a common error.

### Chain Rule Errors
Failing to differentiate the inner function correctly.

### Ignoring Continuity in Limits
Direct substitution is not valid if the function is discontinuous.

## Probability

### Assuming Independence
Events are often assumed independent without justification.

### Incorrect Sample Space
Not listing all possible outcomes leads to wrong probabilities.

---

## Linear Algebra

### Determinant Miscalculation
Sign errors while expanding determinants are common.

### Matrix Multiplication Order
AB ≠ BA in general. Order matters.

---

## General Exam Mistakes

### Skipping Verification
Final answers must be checked against constraints and domain.

### Units and Interpretation Errors
Correct calculation but wrong interpretation leads to loss of marks.
