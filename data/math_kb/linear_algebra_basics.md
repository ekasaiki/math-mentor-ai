## FORMULAS

1. Determinant of a 2×2 matrix

For matrix:
[ a  b ]
[ c  d ]

Determinant = ad − bc


2. Inverse of a 2×2 matrix

If determinant ≠ 0:

Inverse =
1 / (ad − bc) ×
[  d  −b ]
[ −c   a ]


3. Matrix multiplication condition

If A is (m×n) and B is (n×p),
then AB is defined and result is (m×p)


## CONDITIONS

- Matrix must be square to compute determinant
- Determinant ≠ 0 for inverse to exist
- Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative (AB ≠ BA)


## SOLVED PATTERNS

Example 1:
Matrix = [[1, 2],
          [3, 4]]

Determinant = (1×4) − (2×3)
Determinant = 4 − 6 = −2


Example 2:
Matrix = [[2, 1],
          [5, 3]]

Determinant = (2×3) − (1×5)
Determinant = 6 − 5 = 1


Example 3:
If determinant = 0
→ matrix is singular
→ inverse does not exist
